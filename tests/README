A quick note about these tests:

This is a collection of scripts that were used to do "quick and dirty" validation
of a feature without needing to run the whole project. They aren't unit tests or
integration tests - more like one-offs that were probably created and used to
troubleshoot something and then abandoned. Use them with that in mind.
