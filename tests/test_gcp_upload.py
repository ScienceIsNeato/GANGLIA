# This is a quick and dirty test to check that creds are in place and session logs can be uploaded to GCP storage
# Successful output will look like:
#   ‚ùØ python tests/test_gcp_upload.py
#       File /tmp/gcp_test_payload.txt uploaded to ganglia_session_logger.
#       Confirmed: /tmp/gcp_test_payload.txt exists in ganglia_session_logger.
#       Removed test file /tmp/gcp_test_payload.txt.
