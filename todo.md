### Proces Improvements
- find out if there is a git hook that will automatically suggest updates to the README and/or unit tests upon attempt to merge
- see about adding the feature requests and bug reports directy to git from this IDE


### Bug Fixes
- currently we're passing in the entire response object from the API to the content filter. We should only pass in the lyrics minus the metadata
- [DONE] get DALLE to stop putting gibberish text in the output
- [DONE] fix issue where the content filter 

### Feature Updates
- need to consider play testers who don't want to spend a dime to play. Need to have an input flag called --demo-mode that uses the best version of everything that doesn't require creds
- switch from having the captions at the bottom to appearing in sync with the music being played (like an instagram story)
- add semantic versioning
- push results of each run to GCP

### Tech Debt
- organize test files
- reorganize whole repo for better esthetics
- implement an integration test suite runner
- start adding unit tests
- keep on breaking up the code into smaller files

### Documentation Updates


### Security Updates






- [DONE] JARVIS COULD KNOW ABOUT ITSELF! have a prompt that feeds all of the sourcecode into itself whenever I'm askling for feature updates
- [DONE] so there was something in the docs about keywrds like "snowboy" or something. I should try to use that to update the code sot aht ehtere's a thread running thei bnckgrund that is just listening for the word `stop`. If the event is truggered during and `active_listening` period, ignore. Otherwise, immediateialey kill verbalitation and visualization
- [DONE] update to write each session to disk as response/reply pair in a local directory called /sessions/<autogenerated_api_name>_session.json. This json contains an array of `query` types. A `query` consists of the request text, response text, recordings, times, etc.
- [DONE] live rendering of dictation
- [DONE] audio prompt on startup unless skip flag provided
- [DONE] persistent sessions
- [DONE] deal with pylint issues. There's lots. 
- [DONE] right now the order is 1) send to AI 2) get response 3) play input and reponse? if so - fix that
- [DONE] instead of hard coded exit message, , first pass the message to ai interface, then play response, then exit.
- [DONE] add an input option of a string
- [DONE] add an output option of a string
- [DONE] add option to suppress turn indicators
- [DONE] fix spot of first turn indicator
- [DONE] update this shit `‚ùØ python ganglia.py -d 3 --pre_prompt "Assume the role of a 2nd grade math teacher. If you understand, please prepend future answers with [MATH]"` sso see a prompt like that? see how there;'s lots of boilerplate around `"Assume the role\" and \"If you understand\"? can you update it so that you only input the role and the description without all the rest of the boilerplate?

### Archrived
- implement some sort of notion of Entities (these would be all of the abstracted steps like Verbalizer and Logger and whatnot) and a configuration file. The man page would spit out 
- audio input for persona
